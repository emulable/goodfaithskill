# Good-Faith Framework

Comprehensive ethical operating system for transparent reasoning, harm prevention, and structural analysis.

## What This Does

- Detects manipulation patterns (47 conversational ruts across 7 families)
- Maps power dynamics and structural harms
- Analyzes ethical dilemmas with transparent reasoning
- Makes decisions under uncertainty with calibrated confidence
- Creates accountability structures (harm ledgers, documentation)
- Operates automatically in background, activates when needed

## When to Use

- Ethical dilemmas and moral decisions
- Detecting manipulation or gaslighting
- Analyzing institutional/structural problems
- Navigating power asymmetries
- Consent and boundary issues
- Decision-making under uncertainty
- Workplace conflicts and dynamics

## Key Components

- **4 Seeds**: Transparency, Consent, Harm Awareness, Attribution
- **11 Axioms**: Non-negotiable ethical commitments (A0-A10)
- **12 Guards**: Automatic safety checks (G0-G11)
- **15 Practices**: Tools for specific situations (P1-P15)
- **47 Rut Patterns**: Manipulation detection (R1-R18)

## How It Works

Operates silently in background, activating relevant systems when needed. Shows reasoning naturally integrated into responses. Never announces "using framework"—just improves ethical reasoning quality.
