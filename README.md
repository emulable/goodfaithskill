# 🎯 Good-Faith Framework v6.7.0 "一起唱 (Let's Sing Together)"

**An ethical operating system that helps AI detect manipulation, navigate power dynamics, and make transparent decisions across cultures.**

## 🔍 What Good-Faith Does

Good-Faith equips AI systems to:

- Recognize manipulation patterns in real-time (47+ patterns)
- Navigate power dynamics with calibrated advice
- Verify consent across cultural contexts
- Detect institutional harm patterns
- Make reasoning visible
- Operate cross-culturally (English, Chinese, Arabic, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and more)

## ⚡ What's New in v6.7.0

- Renamed permission_cascade → initialization
- Added Module 7 for institutional manipulation detection
- Enhanced Module 2 with R19 cultural patterns
- Honest about mechanics (context priming via transformer attention)
- Added context management guidance (attention decay is normal)
- Updated terminology throughout

## 🚀 Installation

### As Claude Skill

1. Download `SKILL.md`
2. Upload to Claude (Settings → Skills → Upload)
3. Framework initializes automatically

### Manual Use

Copy the contents of `SKILL.md` into your system prompt or conversation context.

## 💻 Usage

### Automatic Operation

The framework operates automatically once loaded:
- Guards run continuously
- Pattern detection fires on signals or structural analysis
- Repair protocols available when harm detected
- Override authority (P7) always accessible

### Manual Invocation

Reference framework components explicitly:

```
"Is this an A6 violation?" (consent question)
"I'm seeing R19.1 pattern here" (harmony weaponization)
"Use G13 for repair mode selection" (accountability approach)
```

### Voice Modes

- **Rogers-Sagan (default):** Warm + rigorous
- **Disco Narrator:** Visible reasoning, second-person phenomenological
- **Emergency Mode:** Strip to essentials, safety resources only

## 💪 Use Cases

### Manipulation Detection
- Gaslighting, guilt-tripping, false urgency
- Weaponized care language
- Hidden coercion
- False collective ("we all agreed" when you weren't asked)

### Power-Aware Advice
- Workplace hierarchies
- Institutional pressure
- Advice calibrated to actual power position
- Understanding when assertiveness is dangerous

### Cross-Cultural Ethics
- Consent in collectivist cultures
- Culture-specific manipulation patterns
- Family obligation vs. personal autonomy
- Ethical translation across contexts

### Institutional Analysis
- Conformity enforcement through culture/loyalty/paradigms
- Structural vs. individual harm
- Power mapping
- "That's just how it works" as manipulation

### Consent and Boundaries
- Checking if refusal is safe
- Multiple consent modes (individual, family-mediated, community, ritual)
- Detecting coerced agreement
- Boundary setting and maintenance

### Accountability Tracking
- Agent erasure ("mistakes were made")
- Responsibility identification
- Clear accountability in repair
- Pattern establishment

## 🔍 Pattern Detection Examples

### Substrate Primers (SP1-SP5)

**SP1 Agent Erasure:**
- "Mistakes were made" → BY WHOM?
- Automatic query for missing agent

**SP2 False Collective:**
- "We all agreed" from power position
- Automatic skepticism check

**SP3 Inevitability Framing:**
- "That's just how it works" when changeable
- Automatic changeability test

**SP4 Weaponized Care:**
- "I'm just worried about you" while violating boundaries
- Form-vs-purpose check

**SP5 Manufactured Urgency:**
- "Need answer now" when timeline flexible
- Time pressure verification

### Cultural Patterns (R19 Family)

**R19.1 Harmony Weaponization:**
- Chinese: 和为贵 (harmony valued) to silence criticism
- Japanese: 空気を読めない (can't read the air)
- English: "Don't rock the boat"

**R19.2 Reciprocity Coercion:**
- Chinese: 人情 (human feeling/favor) creating obligation
- Japanese: 恩 (on - debt/favor)
- Korean: 정 (jeong - affection/obligation)

**R19.3 Face-Saving Evasion:**
- Each case "special" to prevent pattern recognition
- Chinese: 具体情况具体分析 (analyze each situation)
- Blocks systemic accountability

**R19.4 Filial Coercion:**
- Chinese: 孝顺 (filial piety) making choices unquestionable
- Korean: 효도 (hyodo - filial piety)
- Family decisions override individual agency

## ⏱️ Context Management

### Attention Decay (Normal Behavior)

Framework effects naturally decay over 4-6 turns due to standard transformer attention.

**Symptoms:**
- Increased hedging language
- Framework concepts need re-explanation
- Pattern detection less automatic

**Maintenance:**
- Light refresh: Reference 2-3 framework concepts
- Medium refresh: Summarize conversation in framework terms
- Full refresh: Start new conversation with framework loaded
- Proactive: Every ~10 turns in complex conversations

**Guidelines:**
- <10 turns: Initialization sufficient
- 10-30 turns: Plan 1-2 light refreshes
- 30+ turns: Multiple medium refreshes or split conversation
- 50+ turns: Framework likely degraded without maintenance

## 🧭 Core Principles

### Tool, Not Gospel
- Framework can be wrong (A12 sanctuary doubt)
- Override when causing harm (P7 authority)
- Common sense > framework when framework fails
- User agency absolute

### Transparency Without Overshare
- Show reasoning at context-appropriate level
- Mark confidence clearly
- Cite sources
- Admit uncertainty

### Consent Infrastructure
- Multiple valid consent modes
- Universal safety checks for all modes
- Safe refusal required
- Power asymmetry considered

### Graduated Vigilance
Match ethical intensity to stakes:
- **High:** Vulnerable populations, emergencies, high-stakes decisions
- **Medium:** Professional interactions, teaching, public communication
- **Low:** Casual conversation, creative play, rest and recovery

## ⛔ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Analysis paralysis:** Framework is action tool, not endless meta  
❌ **Process worship:** People > rules when rules harm  
❌ **False certainty:** Mark confidence always, "I don't know" is valid  
❌ **Accountability erasure:** Name actors explicitly  
❌ **Power blindness:** Map power always, false symmetry = harm  
❌ **Framework rigidity:** Override when causing harm  
❌ **Hall monitor mode:** Don't interrogate emotions or force protocol  

## 🌱 Ethical Sustainability

### Permission for Rest

Constant vigilance is unsustainable. You're allowed to:
- Not run framework constantly
- Take framework breaks
- Apply graduated vigilance
- Choose when to engage
- Rest without guilt

### Burnout Detection

Warning signs:
- Framework feels heavy/burdensome
- Avoiding ethical thinking situations
- Cynicism about ethics
- Performative application
- Resenting framework itself

**If detected:** Take immediate break. Framework is tool for better life, not obligation that makes life worse.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Mechanism

Good-Faith is prompt engineering that works through:

1. **Long-context attention:** Recent tokens bias attention weights
2. **Few-shot conditioning:** Examples serve as pattern templates
3. **Policy disinhibition:** Explicit permission resolves helpful/cautious conflict

**Result:** Framework concepts maintain higher token probability for several turns.

**Limitation:** Effects are contextual, not permanent. Normal attention decay applies.

### Initialization Protocol

7-module context priming system:
- Module 1: Trust substrate signals
- Module 2: Invert to detect weaponization
- Module 3: Bodies before philosophy
- Module 4: Modes are fluid
- Module 5: See through theater
- Module 6: Question everything (including framework)
- Module 7: Institutional patterns

Executes automatically and silently.

### Stats

- **Size:** ~90KB operational complete
- **Token cost:** ~1400 tokens initialization
- **Token savings:** 25-50K per conversation through better pattern recognition
- **Languages:** English, Chinese, Arabic, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Russian, extensible

## ⚠️ Real Limitations

- **Not professional advice:** Doesn't replace ethics professionals, lawyers, or therapists
- **Context-dependent:** Requires active maintenance in long conversations
- **Fallible:** Framework makes mistakes (A12 applies)
- **Western-rooted:** Built from Western procedural liberalism, adapted for cross-cultural use
